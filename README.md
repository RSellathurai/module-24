# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction - Capstone Project

This project aims to build a reliable machine learning model to predict **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on patient lab results and clinical indicators. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals early using a combination of classical ML models and hyperparameter tuning.

The models are trained on a curated clinical dataset with structured, anonymized features. Key challenges addressed include class imbalance and missing values common in clinical datasets.

## Summary

* Implemented multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
* Performed hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using ROC AUC
* Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
* Handled missing values via imputation
* Selected the best model based on cross-validation performance
